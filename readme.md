# Website Template

This is a simple website template project. 
It uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to render markdown documents to HTML.

If you are already familiar with Quarto, then you can just download this project and edit away. 

If you need a bit more support getting started, I have multiple posts on my website that should help:
