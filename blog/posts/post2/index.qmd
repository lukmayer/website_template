RevealJS is super powerful and has tons of amazing features. Even better, we can embed such presentations into quarto documents since they can be rendered to html.

Here's how to do it:

<iframe src="../../../presentations/pres1.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Definetely make sure to read the Quarto RevealJS documentation as this is not the focus of this template. You can find it [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/index.html) 

I'm pretty sure you can embed other types of interactive content with this method as well, but have not had the chance to try it yet!
