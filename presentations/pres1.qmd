## My website

- [Lukas W. Mayer's website](https://lukmayer.github.io)

- now, some tips about revealjs

## Some tips about revealjs 1

- freeze: true can cause issues 
- if it doesnt look right, go to the _freeze directory
- then check the site_libs directory for a revealjs folder
- delete that folder and re-render the presentation.

## Some tips about revealjs 2

- you may have to render the presentation separately, before rendering the website.
- so edit your presentation with the revealjs freeze folder removed
- then render the presentation file, and then render the website.
